## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- Set up html template with appropriate parents and child elements
- Setting max-width on the container of the page
- Using flex box and its associated properties such as top, left to position and absolute element
- Group elements in one <div>

```html
```jsx
<div class="testimonial--info">
```

```jsx
<h5>Tanya Sinclair</h5>
```

```jsx
<h6> UX Engineer</h6>
```

```jsx
</div>
```
- Using background-position: 

```css
```jsx
*background-image*: url(*./images/pattern-curve.svg*);
```

```jsx
*background-repeat*: no-repeat;
```

```jsx
*background-position*: center bottom;
```

```jsx
*background-size*: contain;
```

```jsx
*font-size*: 80%;
```

```jsx
}
```
```
